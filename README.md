Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The DriverPass project was a client that wanted a system designed that could have a database of users of student drivers who could make and schedule appointments for their driving lessons and tests. The goal was to provide students with a tool for their learning that would always be availble via the internet. 

What did you do particularly well?

I think I did particularly well at going about the design and structure of the project. Understanding what was needed from the system in order for the students to achieve the goal in the end. Brainstorming and putting the parts of the DriverPass system together was my strength. I had some trouble with getting the charts together of the project but felt the design documents were well made.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would most definitely choose my use of the charts such as uml class charts and sequence charts. They can be very useful in the design process and I feel that I could have done much better in their presenation. I would have improved it by making them more carefully, most likely dedicating more time and really looking at what was needed in the chart for the project. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I considered what the user wanted in the end. In this case it was a student driver wanting to schedule and view their appointments and future tests to either have taken or will take. I implemented what the user wanted by providing the means of having a databse of the users info to provide what appointments and lessons they had as well as how to put more in the future for the user to view and manage. It is important to consider the user's needs because the goal of the system design is to make it as smooth and efficient for the user and the user's main goal. If you don't design with the user's wants in mind, you could create an end product that the user does not like or does that help them that well. 

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

I approach designing software by looking at the task or problem that is needed to be solved. What it the goal, what is this software being used for? These are the questions in my head when designing software based on it's purpose. Techniques I would use in the future is the use of the uml charts and other charts alike. I found these to be very useful in taking the parts of the software and breaking them down into the classes and objects and so one of the events that happen within the software. Being able to take specific parts of the software and have a visual of it and what it's doing is makes it not only easier for me to understand, but for clients and users as well.
